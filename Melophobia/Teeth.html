			Electrified harmonious
			<br>
			I think I’ll take it out to the streets
			<br>
			Will somebody please help me
			<br>
			Call the doctor but don’t call the police
		</p>
		<p>
			Are you into the beat?
			<br>
			Are you into the beat?
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth
		</p>
		<p>
			I can feel it in my teeth
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth
			<br>
			And it's driving me mad
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth and it's driving me crazy
			<br>
			It's driving me crazy, it's driving me mad
		</p>
		<p>
			I wish I were an astronaut
			<br>
			Space-case making the scene
			<br>
			Put me in the hospital
			<br>
			Lock me up and throw out the key
			<br>
			Hey, hey, hey, hey, are you into the beat?
			<br>
			I'm the king of the beat
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth
		</p>
		<p>
			I can feel it in my teeth
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth and it’s driving me mad
		</p>
		<p>
			I can feel it in my teeth
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth and it’s driving me crazy
			<br>
			It’s driving me crazy
			<br>
			Now shut up and dance
		</p>
		<p>
			I can feel it in my teeth
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth and it’s driving me mad
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth
			<br>
			I can feel it in my teeth and it’s driving me crazy
			<br>
			It’s driving me crazy
			<br>
			It’s driving me mad
		</p>
