			Did you stand there all alone?
			<br>
			Oh, I cannot explain what's going down
			<br>
			I can see you standing next to me
			<br>
			In and out somewhere else right now
		</p>
		<p>
			You sigh, look away
			<br>
			I can see it clear as day
			<br>
			Close your eyes, so afraid
			<br>
			Hide behind that baby face
		</p>
		<p>
			Do, do, do, do, do, do
		</p>
		<p>
			You can drive all night
			<br>
			Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
			<br>
			You wanna find peace of mind
			<br>
			Looking for the answer
		</p>
		<p>
			Funny how it seems like yesterday
			<br>
			As I recall, you were looking out of place
			<br>
			Gathered up your things and slipped away
			<br>
			No time at all, I followed you into the hall
		</p>
		<p>
			Cigarette daydream
			<br>
			You were only seventeen
			<br>
			Soft speak with a mean streak
			<br>
			Nearly brought me to my knees
		</p>
		<p>
			Do, do, do, do, do
		</p>
		<p>
			You can drive all night
			<br>
			Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
			<br>
			You wanna find peace of mind
			<br>
			Looking for the answer
		</p>
		<p>
			If we could find a reason, a reason to change
			<br>
			Looking for the answer
			<br>
			If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
			<br>
			Standing in the pouring rain
		</p>
		<p>
			Do, do, do, do, do
			<br>
			Do, do, do, do, do
			<br>
			Do, do, do, do, do
			<br>
			Do, do, do, do, do
		</p>
		<p>
			You can drive all night
			<br>
			Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
			<br>
			You wanna find peace of mind
			<br>
			Looking for the answer
		</p>
		<p>
			If we could find a reason, a reason to change
			<br>
			Looking for the answer
			<br>
			If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
			<br>
			Standing in the pouring rain
