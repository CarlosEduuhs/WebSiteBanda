			Baby, you should know by now that I'm right, for you
			<br>
			But every time I step to you, you change your tune
			<br>
			Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breathe
		</p>
		<p>
			I step to the right, you move to the left
			<br>
			Unless no one else
			<br>
			I'd rather die to myself
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, why, won't you make up your mind?
			<br>
			I think I must confess
			<br>
			I'm starting to unwind
		</p>
		<p>
			I been trippin over you
			<br>
			So tell me something new
			<br>
			Take it or leave it
		</p>
		<p>
			Maybe I should pack my things and move on?
			<br>
			Maybe I'm foolin myself and you're already gone?
			<br>
			Watching the flames wither and fade
			<br>
			Trying to make sense of the look on your face
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm down, I'm an itch
			<br>
			Just playin that I can hold on
			<br>
			Oh, why, won't you make up your mind?
		</p>
		<p>
			I think I must confess
			<br>
			I'm learning to unwind
			<br>
			I've been trippin over you
			<br>
			So tell me something
			new
			<br>
			Take it or leave it
		</p>
		<p>
			Baby, please
			<br>
			Oh, baby, please
			<br>
			Stay with me or cut me free
			<br>
			It's all of me
			<br>
			Oh, why, won't you make up your mind?
		</p>
		<p>
			I think I must confess
			<br>
			I'm starting to unwind
			<br>
			I been trippin over you
			<br>
			So tell me something new
			<br>
			Take it or leave it
			<br>
			Take it or leave it
		</p>
