			Doctor, look into my eyes
			<br>
			I've been breathing air but there's no sign of life
			<br>
			Doctor, the problem's in my chest
			<br>
			My heart feels cold as ice but it's anybody's guess
		</p>
		<p>
			Doctor, can you help me? Cause I don't feel right
			<br>
			Better make it fast before I change my mind
			<br>
			Doctor, can you help me? Cause I don't feel right
			<br>
			Better make it fast before I change my mind
		</p>
		<p>
			Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
			<br>
			Darker in the day than the dead of night
			<br>
			Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
			<br>
			Doctor, can you help me? Cause something don't feel right
			<br>
			Something don't feel right
		</p>
		<p>
			Sweet nurse, don't look at me that way
			<br>
			I've seen those eyes before I can tell you want to play
			<br>
			Counselor, give me some advice
			<br>
			Tell me how hard will I fall if I live a double life
		</p>
		<p>
			Doctor, can you help me? Cause I don't feel right
			<br>
			Better make it fast before I change my mind
			<br>
			Doctor, can you help me? Cause I don't feel right
			<br>
			Better make it fast because there ain't	much time
		</p>
		<p>
			Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
			<br>
			Darker in the day than the dead of night
			<br>
			Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
			<br>
			Doctor, can you help me? Cause something don't feel right
			<br>
			Something don't feel right,
			something just ain't right
		</p>
		<p>
			And as the darkness falls it fills up both my eyes
			<br>
			My life before me like a flash in the night
			<br>
			With
			my arms open wide
		</p>
		<p>
			Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
			<br>
			Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
			<br>
			Cold, cold, cold, cold
			inside
			<br>
			Doctor, can you help me? Cause something don't feel right
			<br>
			Something don't feel right,
			something just ain't right
		</p>
