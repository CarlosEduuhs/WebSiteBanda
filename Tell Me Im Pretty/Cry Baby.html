			I think it's pretty strange
			<br>
			Watching the passersby
			<br>
			Crawling all over one another
			<br>
			Trying to get ahead in life
		</p>
		<p>
			Monday you cough
			<br>
			Tuesday you cry
			<br>
			Wednesday in bed
			<br>
			What if you die?
		</p>
		<p>
			You say that I'm insane
			<br>
			I say you're probably right
			<br>
			We all got something important to say
			<br>
			But talking's a waste of time
		</p>
		<p>
			Cry baby cry
			<br>
			Kick, scream, fight
			<br>
			Hold on with all your might
			<br>
			You're gonna die, die
			<br>
			Open up your eyes or life will pass you by
		</p>
		<p>
			Don't you think it's pretty strange?
			<br>
			All got something to hide
			<br>
			House in the desert, top of a mountain
			<br>
			Lost in a deep-sea dive
		</p>
		<p>
			Without love
			<br>
			Without love
			<br>
			Nothing else will ever be enough
		</p>
		<p>
			Cry baby cry
			<br>
			Like it or not
			<br>
			It's a matter of time
			<br>
			It's a matter of time
		</p>
