        <p>
            Slowly drift across the floor, can't escape from my mind
            <br>
            Yet I feel like moving on, but I’m stuck taking my time
            <br>
            A window, a sparrow, a spare room, a shadow
            <br>
            Tied to the place where I told you
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
            <br>
            Everything you wanted seems so far from me
            <br>
            Never meant to hurt you, no, never meant to make you cry
            <br>
            I’m so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
        </p>
        <p>
            Caught me walkin' through the walls, still there's nothing I find
            <br>
            Took the picture from the frame, am I wasting my time?
            <br>
            A stranger, the basement, a table, the pavement
            <br>
            Tied to the place where I left you
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
            <br>
            Everything you wanted seems so far from me
            <br>
            Never meant to hurt you, no, never meant to make you cry
            <br>
            I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
        </p>
        <p>
            Never meant to hurt you, no
            <br>
            Never meant to make you cry
            <br>
            Never meant to hurt you, no
            <br>
            Never meant to hurt you
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m so sorry, honey, for what I’m becoming
            <br>
            Everything you wanted seems so far from me
            <br>
            Never meant to hurt you, no, never meant to make you cry
            <br>
            I'm so sorry, honey, for what I’m becoming
