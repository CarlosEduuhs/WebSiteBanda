			Heart of steel born to kill
			<br>
			Mother's milk left me dressed to shame
			<br>
			I just go my way
			<br>
			Move to fast
			<br>
			It won't last
			<br>
			Hammerhead, Daddy ran away
			<br>
			He still knows my name
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, something's gotta give
			<br>
			The paper on the wall soon will peel and fall
			<br>
			Oh, and then you'll see my face painted up with sin
			<br>
			Cover me, Cover me again
		</p>
		<p>
			I outgrew my old shoes
			<br>
			My back yard was cluttered up with lies
			<br>
			Kept it easy on the eyes
			<br>
			Fresh homemade under shade
			<br>
			Black and red, paint my fingers blue
			<br>
			Still hiding from the truth
		</p>
		<p>
			MM, My best friend kills the pain
			<br>
			MM, But only for a day
			<br>
			MM, Keeps chewing on my veins
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, Something's gotta give
			<br>
			The paper on the wall soon will peel and fall
			<br>
			Oh, then you'll see my face painted up with sin
			<br>
			Cover me, Cover me again
			<br>
			Cover me again
		</p>
