			She move so quick
			<br>
			She move so fast
			<br>
			She move so quick
			<br>
			She make the good times last
			<br>
			She said that even in the morning said you know It's on
			<br>
			Even in the morning
		</p>
		<p>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love, love, love, love
		</p>
		<p>
			She like it rough
			<br>
			She bending bones
			<br>
			She starts a screaming when she's ready to go
			<br>
			She said that even in the morning said you know that it's on
			<br>
			Even in the morning
		</p>
		<p>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love, love, love, love
		</p>
		<p>
			Pretty girl come with me
			<br>
			Two on two
			<br>
			Three on three
			<br>
			Passion is the flavor climbing up this tree
			<br>
			make a fuss
			<br>
			Move around
			<br>
			keep it on uder the groun
			<br>
			Just beneath the covers
			<br>
			i can see the sea
		</p>
		<p>
			She knocking knees
			<br>
			So full of pride
			<br>
			She made the move cause she's got nothing to hide
			<br>
			She said that even in the morning said you know that it's on
			<br>
			Even in the morning
		</p>
		<p>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love
			<br>
			Free love, love, love, love
		</p>
