            [Spoken:] One two three four five six
            <br>
            There was a guy, and his name was Johnny B. The loudest man in the land
        </p>
        <p>
            Alright
            <br>
            Ok
            <br>
            Alright
            <br>
            Ok
            <br>
            Alright
            <br>
            Ok
            <br>
            Uh huh
        </p>
        <p>
            How many more times you cross the line
            <br>
            Run for days with eager eyes
            <br>
            Screaming smile left alone
            <br>
            These crazy things you do
            <br>
            In the forest of your mind
            <br>
            Haunted by the loss of time
            <br>
            Feet stuck frozen in the snow
            <br>
            These crazy things you do
        </p>
        <p>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Oh oh oh
        </p>
        <p>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Oh oh oh
        </p>
        <p>
            Alright
            <br>
            Ok
            <br>
            Alright
            <br>
            Ok
            <br>
            Alright
            <br>
            Ok
            <br>
            Uh huh
        </p>
        <p>
            Japanese from head to toe
            <br>
            Red to green, green to gold
            <br>
            Waiting on that buffalo
            <br>
            These crazy things you do
        </p>
        <p>
            And in my God I see it there
            <br>
            And ah ha ha and oh ho ho
            <br>
            Red to green and green to gold
            <br>
            These crazy things you do
        </p>
        <p>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Oh oh oh
        </p>
        <p>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Shame
            <br>
            Oh oh oh
        </p>
        <p>
            Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
            <br>
            In your heart and in your mind put me
            <br>
            Always aside
            <br>
            Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone
            <br>
            We can play by the rules or just
            <br>
            Leave it alone
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a shame
            <br>
            It's a shame
            <br>
            It's a shame
            <br>
            That your heart has turned to stone
            <br>
            Now your heart's turned to stone
        </p>
        <p>
            Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
            <br>
            In your heart and in your mind
            <br>
            Put me always aside
            <br>
            Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone
            <br>
            We can play by the rules
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a shame
            <br>
            It's a shame
            <br>
            It's a shame
        </p>
