        <p>
            Rolling around like a big rubber ball
            <br>
            Writing this song about some things that I saw
            <br>
            Trying to stand like a big strong tough man
            <br>
            Finding out fast that I'm sinking in sand
        </p>
        <p>
            All I got is nothing but
            <br>
            A little bit of love and gonna
            <br>
            Give it to the people then they'll
            <br>
            See, then they'll see
        </p>
        <p>
            Spinning the tops as the tables they turn
            <br>
            Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn
            <br>
            Cover my tracks, thought I was fine
            <br>
            Got no self control now I'm back here in line
        </p>
        <p>
            All I got is nothing but
            <br>
            A little bit of love and gonna
            <br>
            Give it to the people then they'll
            <br>
            See, then they'll see
        </p>
